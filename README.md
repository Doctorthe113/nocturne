## Nocturne Chat

An open source alternative to [T3Chat](https://t3.chat/)

Nocturne is built with shadcn component, thisd make contribution and custom builds much easier. Shadcn components are not only easy to edit in your favorite editor, it is also easy to theme. You can copy paste themes from online and paste it directly in `Preferences>Customizations>Custom Theme`

You can also bring your own api key, configure system instructions to your liking.

#### Privacy policy

Nocturne by default uses gemini and openai, so both of their privacy policy applies here. I am working on adding support for any openai sdk compatible llm services, which should support local models(such as running a model in lm studio and accessing it via their api)
